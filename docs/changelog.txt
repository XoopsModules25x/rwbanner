=> Version 1.51 Beta 2 (2013-07-24)
===================================
- updated to use any directory, with /rwbanner as the default directory
- added preloads for header.php (mamba)
- standardized language prefixes
- converted several files to UTF-8

=> Version 1.51 Beta 1 (2012-08-12)
===================================
- updated to XOOPS 2.5.x Admin GUI (mamba)

=> Version 1.5 (10/09/2006)
===================================
- Finally, the counting problem for the flash banner was solved. Each action script of the banner module was rewritten
  and the bugs corrected.
- The module was entirely reformulated. Now its code is object-oriented and it is much faster and more stable.
- Added an option for the period of exhibition for the banners. When you add a banner you define a period (in days)
  to show this banner. After this period the banner is deactivated and it won't be shown to the users anymore.
- With a small hack in the xoops core, it's possible to add banners to any modules that accepts bbcode as the news or
  CBB modules. Therefore, now it's possible to show banners inside news, artciles, forum posts and many other places.
  For further information on how to use this hack read the file README.TXT
- Added a function to manage the SMARTY TAGS of the module. Previously to show your banners in the theme of your site
  or in the module templates you had to create the tags manually by inserting the command in the header.php file.
  Now, the hack is still necessary, although you create it only once and after you create, edit, change the status and
  delete the tags directly via the site administation.
- 2 new blocks with DHTML effects were added, Drop-in Banner and LightBox Banner. Now you can give a new highlight to
  your banners.

=> Version 1.4 RC (02/04/2006)
===================================
- New block added. Ajax Banner: this block creates a table with the selected banners based on the configuration criterias and change the shown banners form x to x seconds. The time is also defined in the configurations.
- Templates for all the blocks were created. Now it's much easier to change the exibition format within the blocks.

=> Version 1.3.2 RC1 (23/02/2006)
===================================
New block added. DHTML Banner: this block creates a floating area that closes automatically in X seconds and it has the option to select background and border color, how many banners will be shown, in how many columns, show the banner once each X reloads, among other features.

=> Version 1.3.2 RC (05/02/2006)
===================================
- The click counting bug for flash banners was corrected.
- The screen for adding and editing banners was changed as well as the screen for adding and editing the categories. Now these screens are using the xoops form class.
- To the screen for adding and editing banners was added a field for uploading banners, now it is not necessary anymore to add the url of the image. It's possible to choose the URL or upload option. For flash banners (swf) use only the upload option so that the statistics for this banner work.
- Bugs corrected in the user's side in the module: now the site users that are banner clients can see the statistics of their banners through this area.
- Added the option to acquire a banner per clicks. When the total of clicks acquired is reached, the banner becomes inactive and is not shown anymore.

=> Version 1.3 RC (18/09/2005)
===================================
- The banner exhibition function in the header and in the templates was changed. There was an option added to show one category in one particular module.
